# TESTING
Sharing the TEST knowledge from manual, automation to performance testing.

Software is a vast domain like the ocean. Hope a drop of knowledge to have some ripple effects.

### Type of Testing:

- Unit Test > Test at methods or class level (Whitebox) <br />
- Integration Test > How do individual units/components fit & work together as a whole? <br />
- Functional Test > Use cases <br />
- Regression Test > Test what have been changed <br />
- Stress/Load/Performance Test > How many events/transactions/users can the system handle at the same? concurrency/parallelism <br />
- Acceptance Test > Does the system behave/function to customer's expectations? <br />

TDD/BDD/DDD
