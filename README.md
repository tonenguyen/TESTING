# TESTING
Sharing the TEST knowledge from manual, automation to performance testing.

Software is a vast domain like the ocean. Hope a drop of knowledge to have some ripple effects.

Unit Test > Test at methods or class level (Whitebox)
Integration Test > How do individual units/components fit & work together as a whole?
Functional Test > Use cases
Regression Test > Test what have been changed 
Stress/Load/Performance Test > How many events/transactions/users can the system handle at the same? concurrency/parallelism
Acceptance Test > Does the system behave/function to customer's expectations?

TDD/BDD/DDD
